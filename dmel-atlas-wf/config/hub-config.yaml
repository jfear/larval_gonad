subgroups:
  # The subgroups to use, as specified in sampletable.tsv. The order matters;
  # they will be used to create dimensions.
  columns:
    - group
    - samplename

  # the default sort order can be independent of the columns. Anything missing
  # here will inherit sorting from `columns` above.
  sort_order:
    - samplename

# Colors and regular expressions to search against samplenames. These use `regex.search`
# instead of `regex.match`, so if the pattern can be found anywhere.
#
# Note that this is a list of one-key dicts. The list is prioritized such that
# the first pattern to match a sample wins. The value of each single-value dict
# is itself a list, so you can easily group tracks by color.

# Each dict in the supplemental list will be added to the track hub, under the
# "supplemental view". The dict is passed directly to trackhub.Track(), so
# anything valid there is also valid here.
