# Demo wrapper

*This wrapper demonstrates current best-practices.

The target audience of the wrapper's README should be yourself six months from
now, under a tight deadline, frantically looking for that rule you wrote so you
can copy/paste into a custom Snakefile.

Examples should come first. There should be at least a minimal example and
a reasonably complicated example.*

This demo wrapper simply copies input files to output files.

## Examples

Minimal usage:

```python
rule demo:
    input: 'a.txt'
    output: 'b.txt'
    wrapper:
        'file://path/to/wrapper'
```

"paired-end" usage:

```python
rule demo:
    input:
        R1='a1.txt',
        R2='a2.txt'
    output:
        R1='b1.txt',
        R2='b2.txt'
    wrapper:
        'file://path/to/wrapper'
```
