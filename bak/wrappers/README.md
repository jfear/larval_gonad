[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lcdb/lcdb-wrapper-tests.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lcdb/lcdb-wrapper-tests)

## Setup

While wrappers run in their own conda environment, we still have some
dependencies for the tests themselves. For example, one of the HISAT2 tests
verifies that the index has the correct chromosomes by running
`hisat2-inspect`, so `hisat2` is a dependency.

With the [`bioconda`](https://bioconda.github.io/) channel set up, install
the dependencies:

```
conda create -n testenv --file requirements.txt
```

And run tests:

```
source activate testenv
pytest test/tests.py -v
```

## Writing a test

### Terminology
Here, a **test** is a function that specifically checks output to ensure it is
as expected.

A **fixture** is setup for a test. It can possibly itself be a test (if it
checks expected output) but doesn't have to be.

An example of a **fixture** would be a function that downloads a fastq file for
use in other tests. Another example of a fixture would be a function that runs
cutadapt on that fastq, and provides that trimmed fastq for other tests. An
example of a test would be a function that checks the cutadapt output to ensure
it is as expected.

### New tests
See `test/test_demo.py` for a heavily-annotated example, and
`test/raw_data_fixtures.py` for useful fixtures.

Write new tests in `tests/test_<wrappername>.py`. Put any fixtures at the top
of the file. Import any fixtures from other files as needed. There is
a `raw_data_fixtures.py` file that will be helpful.

A test consists of a Snakefile (typically written as a triple-quoted string
inside each test function), an input data function (typically created via
`utils.symlink_in_tempdir`), and a function that performs arbitrary tests on
the output.

**Importantly, for any test, you can go to
`/tmp/pytest-of-$USER/pytest-$N/$TEST_NAME` directory and you'll see the
Snakefile, input data, and any created output files.** This is useful for
writing the tests in the first place (e.g., what kinds of things to test for)
or for troubleshooting (e.g., go to the directory and run `snakemake` to see
what happens).


## Some notes on how the fixtures work

`py.test` *fixtures* are functions. They are used for things like setup and
teardown that needs to be done once, or for preparing data just once that can
be used across many tests. In this repo, the fixtures are primarily used for
downloading data from the testing data repo to a test-specific temporary
directory.

Fixtures are stored in a `conftest.py` file (see `tests/conftest.py`). Any
discovered pytest tests in any module (functions starting with `test_`) can use
any of these fixtures as an argument, and will get the return value of that
fixture at runtime.

pytest also has some built-in fixtures. Here we use the `tmpdir` fixture and
the `tmpdir_factory` fixture. The nice thing about these is that pytest
manages them on disk and only keeps the last handful of tempdirs. This makes it
straightforward to find the test data on disk and poke around when
troubleshooting.

Fixtures can use other fixtures, and what's really nice is that py.test handles
all of the dependencies across fixtures. For example, we can have a fixture
that downloads a FASTQ file and another fixture that runs FastQC on the FASTQ.
Then we can have a MultiQC test that uses the FastQC fixture as input. Py.test
will figure that out and create and clean up tempdirs as needed.

I'm still working out the best way to do this. As one extreme, we could
maintain a single big Snakefile for each set of mutually compatible wrappers,
and returns a big dict of all the files created. This does a high-level
functional test of all of the wrappers, while the more specific wrapper tests
could verify the contents.

The other extreme is to have a separate fixture for every stage of the
workflow.
