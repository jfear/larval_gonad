# Galletta Paper

These are comments from the Galletta paper using these data. I will address
these questions here.

* It is clear that PLP decreases following the spermatogonia stage, but stating
  that it is "exhausted or degraded" sounds like it is eliminated.

  * For the RNAseq data, it was evident that the levels between spermatogonia
  and spermatocytes were significantly reduced as presented in Figure 5, and
  this was apparently measured by the numbers of reads for each associated
  gene.

  * More explanation of the RNAseq data and how it quantitatively established
  a significant reduction in spermatocytes should be provided including the
  numbers of reads for the relevant genes indicated in the table in Figure 5B
  for each cell category.

  * It is also not clear how the cell type assignments shown in Figure 5 were
  made. Perhaps these details are included in the unpublished manuscript
  cited (Mahadevaraju et al.).

* Did the RNA seq data provide an expression profile for the alternative plp
  mRNAs expressed in the different cell types?
