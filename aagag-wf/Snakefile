"""Workflow for checking for AAGAG(n) repeats

Brian had sent this paper around:

> Mills, Wilbur K., Yuh Chwen G. Lee, Antje M. Kochendoerfer, Elaine M. Dunleavy, and Gary H. Karpen. n.d. “RNA
> Transcribed from Heterochromatic Simple-Tandem Repeats Are Required for Male Fertility and Histone-Protamine Exchange
> in Drosophila Melanogaster.” https://doi.org/10.1101/617175.

They found that the tandem repeats were found in primary spermatocytes (larval and adult) and that it was required
for fertility.

Here I look to summarize how many reads and what cells the AAGAGx3 repeats are in.
